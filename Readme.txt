This is the folder that will contain our rover game. Any changes to the game should be pushed and sync so that everyone is working on the same/similar versions of the game.

That Being said, try and make sure changes you upload work or at least don't crash the game, and if they don't explain why so that one of the other people can look into it. When Pushing a change, make an informative title and try and be accurate as to what changes you've made in the description. I like to make bullet points saying all my changes but anything is fine.

This first commit will only have the readme since Khan is the one with the "prototype" at the moment.
